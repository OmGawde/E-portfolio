        <p>I am a passionate AI and Embedded Systems Developer specializing in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time edge AI solutions.<br>

            To bring this vision to life, I am working on deploying the system on an ESP32 microcontroller, integrating an AI Thinker camera and an SD card for real-time monitoring.<br> 
            My expertise lies in developing and optimizing AI models for embedded systems, ensuring efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware like ESP32.<br>
            I have a multimodal learning style, excelling in visual (diagrams, charts, videos), auditory (discussions, explanations), and kinesthetic (hands-on, real-world applications) learning.
            Research
            fascinates me, and I enjoy diving deep into topics to find the best solutions.<br> I strive for perfection
            in everything I do, constantly refining my skills and ideas.<br> Apart from my technical interests, I have a
            deep appreciation for literature and art,<br> which inspire my creativity and critical thinking."
